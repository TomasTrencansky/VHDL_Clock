## Descritpion
Our team decided to build not just a clock, but **THE Clock**. We built your typical clock features into it, like a stopwatch, a timer, an alarm, and of course, a digital clock. Our Clock is not using any external peripherals, just the Nexys A7 50-T board and it's built in seven segment display and buttons. 
# But what do each of the buttons do?
1. Left and Right buttons are for changing modes
2. Up and Down buttons are for setting the time
3. Center button is for activating the functions
We also built in the function where if you hold the button for a few the speed of change increases.
